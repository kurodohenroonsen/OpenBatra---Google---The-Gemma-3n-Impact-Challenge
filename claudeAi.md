# Gemini Nano to Gemma 3n Web Migration Guide

**Gemma 3n represents a paradigm shift in on-device AI**, moving from Chrome's browser-integrated Gemini Nano to explicit model deployment with revolutionary MatFormer architecture, multimodal capabilities, and 1.5x performance improvements. This migration unlocks offline-first privacy, eliminates API costs, and enables sophisticated multimodal processing directly in web browsers.

The transition requires fundamental architectural changes but delivers unprecedented control over AI inference, memory optimization through Per-Layer Embeddings (PLE), and access to Google's $150,000 Gemma 3n Impact Challenge. Current browser support spans 70% of the global market through WebGPU, with fallback options ensuring broad compatibility.

## Technical migration requires replacing Chrome's window.ai APIs with Transformers.js or Google AI Edge

**API Architecture Changes**

Gemini Nano operates through Chrome's built-in Prompt API with browser-managed sessions, while Gemma 3n requires explicit model loading and lifecycle management. The shift moves from simple text prompts to comprehensive multimodal support with developer-controlled memory management.

```javascript
// Gemini Nano - Browser-managed sessions
if ('ai' in window) {
  const session = await window.ai.createTextSession();
  const response = await session.prompt("Your prompt here");
}

// Gemma 3n - Explicit model deployment
import { AutoProcessor, AutoModelForImageTextToText } from "@huggingface/transformers";

const model_id = "onnx-community/gemma-3n-E2B-it-ONNX";
const processor = await AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id);
const model = await AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(model_id, {
  dtype: {
    embed_tokens: "q8",
    vision_encoder: "fp16",
    decoder_model_merged: "q4"
  },
  device: "webgpu" // or "cpu" for WASM fallback
});
```

**Browser Compatibility Matrix**

Gemini Nano requires Chrome Canary with experimental flags, limiting deployment to Chrome ecosystem only. Gemma 3n supports broader browser compatibility through WebGPU (Chrome, Edge, Firefox with flags, Safari with flags) and WASM fallback for universal support.

Progressive enhancement enables graceful degradation across browser capabilities:

```javascript
class AIService {
  async initialize() {
    if ('gpu' in navigator) {
      this.model = await this.loadModel("webgpu");
      this.device = "webgpu";
    } else {
      console.warn("WebGPU unavailable, falling back to CPU");
      this.model = await this.loadModel("cpu");
      this.device = "cpu";  
    }
  }
}
```

**Integration with Transformers.js**

Transformers.js version 3.6.0+ provides the primary integration path for Gemma 3n web deployment. Text-only implementation requires minimal setup, while multimodal capabilities demand careful preprocessing and model configuration.

```javascript
// Multimodal implementation
const image = await load_image("path/to/image.jpg");
const inputs = await processor(image, "Describe this image");
const output = await model.generate(inputs);
```

## MatFormer architecture delivers 1.5x performance with revolutionary memory optimization

**Per-Layer Embeddings Innovation**

The breakthrough Per-Layer Embeddings (PLE) technique reduces memory footprint by ~50% while maintaining quality. E2B operates with 2GB RAM (5B total parameters), E4B with 3GB RAM (8B total parameters). This innovation stores layer-specific embeddings on flash memory while keeping core transformer weights in high-speed memory.

**KV Cache Sharing Acceleration**

KV Cache Sharing provides **2x improvement** on prefill performance compared to Gemma 3 4B. Keys and values from middle layers share across top layers, dramatically accelerating long-context processing essential for audio and video stream processing.

**Elastic Inference Capabilities**

MatFormer's nested transformer design enables dynamic switching between E2B and E4B inference paths within a single model. This "Matryoshka" architecture allows custom model sizes between 2B-4B parameters for specific hardware constraints and quality-latency tradeoffs.

```javascript
// Conditional parameter loading for memory optimization
const model = await AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(model_id, {
  dtype: {
    embed_tokens: "q8",     // Lower precision for embeddings
    vision_encoder: "fp16",  // Skip if no image input needed
    audio_encoder: "skip",   // Skip if no audio input needed
    decoder_model_merged: "q4"
  }
});
```

**Performance Benchmarks**

Google AI Edge LLM Inference achieves up to 2,585 tokens/sec on prefill with Gemma 3 1B. Mobile performance on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra shows E2B INT4 reaching ~800 tok/sec prefill and ~45 tok/sec decode with 2GB memory usage.

## Modern browser APIs unlock sophisticated offline-first AI experiences

**Service Workers for Model Caching**

Service Workers enable comprehensive offline AI capabilities through intelligent model caching, stale-while-revalidate strategies, and background pre-loading. Gemma 3n models (1-3GB) require careful cache management with compression and cleanup strategies.

```javascript
// Advanced caching with dynamic model loading
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  if (event.request.url.includes('/models/')) {
    event.respondWith(
      caches.match(event.request).then(response => {
        if (response) return response;
        
        return fetch(event.request).then(networkResponse => {
          const responseClone = networkResponse.clone();
          caches.open('gemma-models').then(cache => {
            cache.put(event.request, responseClone);
          });
          return networkResponse;
        });
      })
    );
  }
});
```

**WebCodecs API for Real-time Media Processing**

WebCodecs integration enables 60fps video processing on Pixel-class hardware with hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding. Real-time video analysis, audio transcription, and content-aware processing become feasible through Gemma 3n's multimodal capabilities.

```javascript
class GemmaVideoProcessor {
  async processFrame(frame) {
    const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(frame.width, frame.height);
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx.drawImage(frame, 0, 0);
    
    const imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, frame.width, frame.height);
    const analysis = await this.gemmaInference(imageData);
    
    this.overlayAnalysis(ctx, analysis);
    frame.close();
  }
}
```

**File System Access API for Efficient Model Management**

Origin Private File System (OPFS) provides high-performance model storage with direct access capabilities. Synchronous access handles enable in-place model loading without memory copying, essential for large model deployment.

```javascript
// OPFS for Gemma 3n model management
const fileHandle = await this.modelsDir.getFileHandle(`${modelName}.task`);
const accessHandle = await fileHandle.createSyncAccessHandle();
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(accessHandle.getSize());
accessHandle.read(buffer, { at: 0 });
```

**Web Workers for Background AI Processing**

Dedicated workers enable non-blocking inference with hardware concurrency optimization. Worker pooling, priority queuing, and load balancing ensure responsive user experiences while maximizing processing throughput.

## Browser extension implementation requires careful architecture for optimal performance

**Chrome Extension Architecture**

Browser extensions benefit from Service Worker patterns with manifest v3 compliance. Background processing through dedicated workers prevents UI blocking while maintaining responsive interactions.

```javascript
// Background.js - Service Worker Pattern
class AIExtensionManager {
  async processQuery(text, options = {}) {
    if (!this.modelLoaded) await this.initializeModel();
    
    const response = await this.engine.chat.completions.create({
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        { role: "user", content: text }
      ],
      temperature: options.temperature || 0.7,
      max_tokens: options.maxTokens || 150
    });
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content;
  }
}
```

**Structured Output with JSON Schema**

JSON Schema constraints enable reliable structured output generation through prompt engineering and validation. Response validation ensures schema compliance for downstream processing.

```javascript
const responseSchema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    summary: { type: "string", description: "Brief summary" },
    sentiment: { type: "string", enum: ["positive", "negative", "neutral"] },
    confidence: { type: "number", minimum: 0, maximum: 1 }
  },
  required: ["summary", "sentiment"]
};

// Structured generation implementation
const systemPrompt = `You must respond with valid JSON matching this schema:
${JSON.stringify(schema, null, 2)}`;
```

**Local Storage Strategies**

Chrome storage APIs combined with IndexedDB enable efficient model caching and conversation persistence. Compression, cleanup policies, and storage quota management prevent bloat while maintaining performance.
